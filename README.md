# StormEngine

StormCore is a modular Godot-based game development framework built around:

- A plugin/adapter architecture
- Event-bus driven communication
- Data-driven testing
- Scalable template structure for rapid prototyping

This repository contains:

- **StormEngine-Core** – foundational scripts, buses, adapters, and contract testing tools 
- **StormEngine-Template** – a minimal starter template for new projects built on the engine 

StormEngine is designed for personal use, experimentation, and rapid iteration. 
It is intentionally lightweight, modular, and extensible.

## Features

- Adapter-based plugin architecture
- Event bus communication layer
- Automatic adapter discovery
- JSON-driven dynamic test system
- GUTS-based contract and integration tests
